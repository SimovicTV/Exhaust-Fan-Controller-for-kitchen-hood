# 🏠 Smart Kitchen Hood Controller

I wanted to make my kitchen a little smarter by upgrading my **regular range hood** — three fan speeds and a light — to a **smart device** I could control via **Home Assistant**, and later automate with sensors.

After looking at DIY projects online, most seemed too time-consuming, so I decided to build a **simple, practical solution**.

## ⚡ Components Used

* 🔌 **4-Channel Tuya Smart Switch (220V Wi-Fi module)** – minimal internal modifications required
  [AliExpress link](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005945056792.html)
  
* 🛠️ Relay Module – Reprogrammed to control fan speeds and light. Requires minimal hardware changes.*
<sub>*Or no changes, if you don't mind a "spaghetti salad" of wires.</sub>

## ✨ Features

* 💨 Control **fan speeds** and 💡 light via **Home Assistant**
* 🤖 Integrates with sensors and automation for hands-free operation
* 🧰 Minimal wiring and modifications

I’ll be adding **photos** soon to make the setup and wiring clearer.


## 💡 What This Device Does

This project turns a **regular kitchen range hood** into a **smart, 3-speed fan with a controllable light**, fully integrated with **Home Assistant**. You can control it both via physical buttons and through the Home Assistant interface, including automations and sliders.

### ⚙️ Main Features

1. **Fan Speed Control**

   * The hood has **three fan speeds**.
   * Each speed is controlled by a separate **relay** (`relay1`, `relay2`, `relay3`) so only one speed is active at a time.
   * A **master switch** ensures only one relay is active and controls the overall fan power.

2. **Light Control**

   * The hood’s built-in light can be toggled independently via a dedicated **relay** (`lightfan`).
   * Controlled either through a physical button or Home Assistant.

3. **Physical Buttons**

   * Buttons are mapped to:

     * **Fan speed 1, 2, or 3**
     * **Light toggle**
   * Pressing a button sets the corresponding speed or toggles the light. Pressing the same speed button again turns the fan off.

4. **Home Assistant Integration**

   * A **slider** in Home Assistant allows you to select the fan speed (1–3).
   * Automations and sensors can control the fan via the **master switch** and `apply_speed` script.
   * The system updates instantly and optimistically, meaning changes are reflected in Home Assistant even before confirmation from the device.

5. **Scripts and Logic**

   * `apply_speed`: Central handler that sets the correct relay for the chosen speed.
   * `set_speed_1/2/3`: Scripts triggered by physical buttons to update the speed and master switch.
   * Master switch (`master`): Controls whether the fan is on or off. When off, all relays turn off.

6. **Safety & Reliability**

   * **Interlock** ensures only one fan relay can be on at a time, preventing multiple speeds from being activated simultaneously.
   * **Debounce filters** on physical buttons prevent accidental double presses.

7. **Status Reporting**

   * Device reports **Wi-Fi info**, **IP**, **MAC address**, and **ESPHome version** via text sensors.

### 🛠 How It Works

* When you press a **speed button**, the corresponding script sets the `fanspeed` number and toggles the **master switch**.
* The `apply_speed` script then turns on the correct relay (`relay1`, `relay2`, or `relay3`) for the chosen speed and ensures the other relays are off.
* Pressing the **light button** toggles the `lightfan` relay without affecting the fan speed.
* The fan can also be controlled directly from Home Assistant via the **slider** or automations.

---

In short, this device is a **smart, fully automated kitchen hood** that can be controlled both manually and digitally, with clear feedback, safety interlocks, and full Home Assistant integration.

### 🔹 Key Notes

* **Relay1–Relay3** → Control **fan speeds**. Only one relay can be on at a time (interlock).
* **RelayLight** → Controls the hood **light** independently.
* **Master Switch** → Main fan power; when off, all fan relays turn off.
* **Buttons** → Physical control for each fan speed and light toggle. Pressing the same speed again turns the fan off.
* **Home Assistant** → Fan speed slider and light toggle supported, plus automation integration.
