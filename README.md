Turning a Regular Kitchen Hood into a Smart One

Like many people interested in smart homes, I wanted to make my house a little smarter and give some of my old appliances a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù upgrade. My goal was to find the simplest and most affordable way to do it ‚Äî without sacrificing functionality.

While exploring different ideas online, I discovered tons of DIY projects out there. Most of them looked great, but they also required a lot of time and effort to build. That‚Äôs what inspired me to create my own version ‚Äî something practical, simple, and effective.

The project started with my kitchen range hood, which has three fan speeds and a built-in light. I wanted to be able to control it directly through Home Assistant, and later even integrate it with sensors and automations for hands-free control.

To make this possible, I used a 4-channel relay module, which I reprogrammed to work with my setup. (There‚Äôs plenty of information online about how to do this, so I won‚Äôt go into the details here.)

This simple modification turned my regular kitchen hood into a smart device ‚Äî one that can now respond to automations, schedules, and remote commands, all from Home Assistant.

Here‚Äôs a **blog-style version** that matches the tone and flow of your previous text perfectly:

For this project, I used a **4-channel Tuya Smart Switch (220V Wi-Fi module)**, which turned out to be a great choice since it only requires a few simple internal modifications.
